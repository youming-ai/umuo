// Manual declarations for the worker tsconfig, which does not include the root
// env.d.ts (whose Env is what `/src/data/api` exports). They must match the
// bindings in wrangler.toml, which declares no [vars].
//
// `ASSETS` is genuinely needed here, not descriptive: removing it makes
// `handle(request, env, ctx)` in entrypoint.ts fail to typecheck, because the
// generated chain does not supply it inside this program. That is the same
// reason the whole file exists rather than relying on worker-configuration.d.ts.
