-- The Poche pivot fabricated a topic tag out of the category: the feed carries
-- no <category> tags at all, so storeArticle wrote articles.category into
-- article_tags to keep it queryable there. The category already lives in
-- articles.category and every consumer reads it from the row, so the mirror
-- only duplicated information — the card rendered "Development · development"
-- and the RSS emitted <category>category:development</category> *and*
-- <category>tag:development</category>.
--
-- Scoped to the Poche corpus on purpose: a pre-pivot row may legitimately carry
-- a real topic tag that happens to equal its category, and those rows keep
-- their tags. This deletes rows, unlike retention — but article_tags is a
-- derived table with no dedupe role, so nothing is lost that the next tick
-- would need; the articles rows themselves are untouched.
--
-- Why the match is exact rather than a guess, despite article_tags carrying no
-- provenance marker: for a Poche row every tag can only ever have been the
-- fabricated mirror. `RawArticle` has no `tags` field, `parseRss` extracts no
-- tags from the feed (only category/title/description/url/image/dates), and
-- `src/feeds/enrich.ts` is the sole writer of `article_tags` — every other
-- reference in the codebase is a read. So no path exists that could have
-- written a publisher tag on a `poche-explore` article, and `tag = category`
-- selects precisely the fabricated set.
